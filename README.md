# Safe DSA

This repository aims to collect safe, correct, and generic implementations
of various algorithms and data structures as I learn more about them.

## What is special about this repository?

All algorithms and data structures are implemented with the following
principles in mind:

- Good enough documentation
- Good preconditions and postconditions
- Good loop invariants and struct invariants
- Genericity whenever possible
- Provable correctness and safety
- Avoid overflows (such as common binary search mistakes)

## What do I hope to learn from this project?

- Be more familiar with advanced Rust features like
  macros and generics
- Review algorithms I already know
- Try to implement algorithms I learn in math and CS lectures
- Learn new algorithms I do not yet know
- Avoid using AI code completion or code generation
